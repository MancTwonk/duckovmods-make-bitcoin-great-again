## üìñ About This Mod

Ever wished Bitcoin prices actually moved like real crypto? This mod brings volatile market dynamics to your Bitcoin farming with fully configurable price fluctuations and mining speeds.

Set your own market chaos - choose how often prices update (2-10 minutes) and how wild the swings get (up to 50% volatility). You can even boost your mining speed up to 20x or slow it down if you want a more of a grind.

Price changes happen randomly within your settings (set 5 minutes = changes occur anywhere from 2-5 minutes), making timing your sales an actual strategy.

**You might check your stash and find your Bitcoin jumped 30% in value, or dropped just as much!**

<u>Keep in mind the trader in game buys items at -50% of the market value.</u>

You can control the mod via the in game setting menu (Esc -> Settings -> Bitcoin Settings)

You can enable the HUD price trend indicator to give you a quick visual of the current Bitcoin price trend.

If you are sat around in your hideout when the price changes you will see an in game notification showing you the price change.

**Also now supports all in game languages!**

(also added a Chinese title & description for this mod on steam so no more dual languages on the mod page)

<u>Latest Changes</u>

<u>v1.5.1 - MINOR FEATURE ADDED</u>
- üÜï ADDED: New settings to configure the minimum and maximum Bitcoin price
range during market updates. This allows you to set boundaries for how low or
high the Bitcoin price can go, adding an extra layer of control over your market
experience. the old values were 16k min and 150k max so if you had those set
previously it will remain the same unless you change them in the settings menu.
