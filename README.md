## 📖 About This Mod

Ever wished Bitcoin prices actually moved like real crypto? This mod brings volatile market dynamics to your Bitcoin farming with fully configurable price fluctuations and mining speeds.

Set your own market chaos - choose how often prices update (2-10 minutes) and how wild the swings get (up to 50% volatility). You can even boost your mining speed up to 20x or slow it down if you want a more of a grind.

Price changes happen randomly within your settings (set 5 minutes = changes occur anywhere from 2-5 minutes), making timing your sales an actual strategy.

[u]Keep in mind the trader in game buys items at -50% of the market value.[/u]
